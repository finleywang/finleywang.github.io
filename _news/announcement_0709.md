Introduction

Multivariate time series (MTS) data are ubiquitous in complex dynamic systems such as meteorology, transportation, and energy.However, data heterogeneity caused by cross-domain variations has become a central bottleneck restricting model generalization and consistency in comparative studies. This paper systematically reviews recent MTS forecasting research, revealing that inconsistencies in experimental conclusions primarily arise from neglecting substantial differences in data distributions and characteristics. To address this issue, we introduce BasicTS, an fair and scalable benchmark designed to fairly quantify the impact of heterogeneity on model performance. Subsequently, to tackle generalization challenges posed by heterogeneity, this tutorial proposes two adaptive solutions: (i) developing BLAST, a balanced and diversity-enhanced pre-training corpus that explicitly models heterogeneity, significantly improving zero-shot general forecasting; and (ii) introducing ARIES, a relational assessment and model recommendation framework that leverages a statistical pattern-to-model matching mechanism to automatically select optimal forecasting models for specific real-world sequences. Through comprehensive experiments and case studies, we demonstrate that precisely characterizing and leveraging data heterogeneity, beyond mere model design, is crucial for improving the robustness of MTS forecasting. This research provides methodological guidance and practical insights for academia and industry to fully exploit the value of time series data and make data-driven decisions.

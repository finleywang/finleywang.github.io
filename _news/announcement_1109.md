Our workshop entitled ["The 2nd International Workshop on Spatio-Temporal Data Mining from the Web"（WebST 2026）](https://webst2025.netlify.app/#about), has been accepted by [THE ACM WEB CONFERENCE 2026](https://www2026.thewebconf.org/).

Introduction

WebST 2026 is a comprehensive half-day workshop (with at least 8 accepted papers, 3 keynote talks, and over 70 attendees) at WWW 2026, catering to professionals, researchers, and practitioners who are interested in sensing, mining, and understanding big and heterogeneous spatio-temporal data generated from the web (e.g., social media posts, geotagged images, mobility traces) to tackle real-world challenges, such as climate change, disaster response, urban planning, and location-based social networks. The workshop will not only offer a platform for knowledge exchange but also acknowledge outstanding contributions through a distinguished Best Paper Award. Furthermore, we envision the publication of accepted papers in a special issue, organized in reputable journals such as ACM Transactions on Big Data and ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology. This workshop would be sponsored by JD Technology, with other committee members from MIT, CMU, UCB, etc. Note that this will be the fifth time that our core members have organized a similar workshop. The previous 14 workshops were hosted with SIGKDD, IJCAI, and WWW, each of which attracted over 70 participants and 30 submissions on average.

About WWW

Since its inception in 1989, the World Wide Web has revolutionized how we live, work, and connect. The Web Conference, formerly known as the International World Wide Web Conference (WWW), has served as the premier annual forum for presenting and discussing cutting-edge research, technological developments, standards, and applications that continue to shape the Web’s future.

For more than three decades, The Web Conference has been the stage for groundbreaking innovations that have shaped the Internet as we know it. Seminal contributions first presented here include the Anatomy of a Large-Scale Web Search Engine in 1998, which prefigured Google; the EigenTrust algorithm in 2003; and the YAGO knowledge base in 2007 (see past recipients of the Test of Time Award). Each year, the conference brings together scholars, researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and users with a shared mission: to imagine and build the future of the Web.

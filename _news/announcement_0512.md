Cover Story

From the scorched cracks on Shang Dynasty oracle bones to AlphaFold's deciphering of protein folding, from Go's strategic warfare to financial quantitative trading, human civilization epitomizes an evolutionary journey of decision intelligence. Foundation models are reshaping decision-making paradigms across financial transactions to scientific discovery. This interdisciplinary review crystallizes three critical dimensions: (1) Paradigm Transcendence – How generative AI triggers paradigm leaps in decision intelligence? (2) Nuclear Transformation –How foundation models construct new decision topologies amid uncertainty? (3) Application Singularity – Where lies the frontier when world models and multimodal reasoning technologies empower decision intelligence? By decoding the "technological DNA" – from the elegant proof of the Seven Bridges Problem to Transformers' emergent decision capabilities – this review traces the evolution, paradigms, technologies, and applications of decision intelligence. It reveals a pivotal trend: foundation models are sparking a "Cambrian Explosion" in decision science. The convergence of decision intelligence and foundation models may herald the dawn of a new intelligent species.
Illustrated by Yongjun Xu, Cheems Wang, Fei Wang, Xingxing Liang, Sihang Qiu, Tingting Li, Xuefei Li, Libo Huang, Boqiang Li, Wei Zhao, Xianxi Dong, Meng Liang, and Ke Chen.

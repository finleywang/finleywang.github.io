Dr. Fei Wang is currently an Associate Professor at Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). He belongs to Research Center for Intelligent Equipment Systems and State Key Laboratory of AI Safety. He is working on the research, development, and application of spatio-temporal data mining, timeseries forecasting and AI4Science. Prior to that, he obtained his PhD degree at ICT, CAS under the supervision of Prof. Yongjun Xu. He is now also supervised by Prof. Xueqi Cheng. He published 50+ papers in journals (e.g., The Innovation, TKDE, TVT) and conferences (such as KDD, ICDE, AAAI, ICML, MM and CIKM). His publications collectively gathered 4,000+ citations on Google Scholar, with h-index of 21. Among them, one paper was awarded as Best Paper by the world class journal The Innovation, one paper was awarded as Best Student Paper by DASFAA 2022, four papers (STEP, GinAR, STID, DSFormer) were selected as the most influential papers ranked by PaperDigest. He has served as the Youth Editor of The Innovation (IF=33.2, the 4th Multidisciplinary Journal over the world; CiteScore=53.4 the 2nd Multidisciplinary Journal over the world), and PC for prestigious conferences, including KDD, NeurIPS, IJCAI, MM, AAAI and so on.

His research interests mainly lie in:
1. Spatio-temporal (ST) data mining: ST foundation models, ST data synthesis, fair and scalable benchmark for ST models.
2. Time series analysis: foundation models, forecasting in critical scenarios, high-efficiency model architecture.
3. AI for Science: ST datamining in Urban Science, Atmospheric Science, Ocean Science, Marine Science.

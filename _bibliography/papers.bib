  abstract = {Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting plays a vital role in a wide range of applications. Recently, Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have become increasingly popular MTS forecasting methods. STGNNs jointly model the spatial and temporal patterns of MTS through graph neural networks and sequential models, significantly improving the prediction accuracy. But limited by model complexity, most STGNNs only consider short-term historical MTS data, such as data over the past one hour. However, the patterns of time series and the dependencies between them (i.e., the temporal and spatial patterns) need to be analyzed based on long-term historical MTS data. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, in which STGNN is Enhanced by a scalable time series Pre-training model (STEP). Specifically, we design a pre-training model to efficiently learn temporal patterns from very long-term history time series (e.g., the past two weeks) and generate segment-level representations. These representations provide contextual information for short-term time series input to STGNNs and facilitate modeling dependencies between time series. Experiments on three public real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework is capable of significantly enhancing downstream STGNNs, and our pre-training model aptly captures temporal patterns.},

  abstract = {We all depend on mobility, and vehicular transportation affects the daily lives of most of us. Thus, the ability to forecast the state of traffic in a road network is an important functionality and a challenging task. Traffic data is often obtained from sensors deployed in a road network. Recent proposals on spatial-temporal graph neural networks have achieved great progress at modeling complex spatial-temporal correlations in traffic data, by modeling traffic data as a diffusion process. However, intuitively, traffic data encompasses two different kinds of hidden time series signals, namely the diffusion signals and inherent signals. Unfortunately, nearly all previous works coarsely consider traffic signals entirely as the outcome of the diffusion, while neglecting the inherent signals, which impacts model performance negatively. To improve modeling performance, we propose a novel Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Framework (DSTF) that separates the diffusion and inherent traffic information in a data-driven manner, which encompasses a unique estimation gate and a residual decomposition mechanism. The separated signals can be handled subsequently by the diffusion and inherent modules separately. Further, we propose an instantiation of DSTF, Decoupled Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (D2STGNN), that captures spatial-temporal correlations and also features a dynamic graph learning module that targets the learning of the dynamic characteristics of traffic networks. Extensive experiments with four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the framework is capable of advancing the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract = {Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting plays a vital role in a wide range of applications. Recently, Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have become increasingly popular MTS forecasting methods due to their state-of-the-art performance. However, recent works are becoming more sophisticated with limited performance improvements. This phenomenon motivates us to explore the critical factors of MTS forecasting and design a model that is as powerful as STGNNs, but more concise and efficient. In this paper, we identify the indistinguishability of samples in both spatial and temporal dimensions as a key bottleneck, and propose a simple yet effective baseline for MTS forecasting by attaching <u>S</u>patial and <u>T</u>emporal <u>ID</u>entity information (STID), which achieves the best performance and efficiency simultaneously based on simple Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). These results suggest that we can design efficient and effective models as long as they solve the indistinguishability of samples, without being limited to STGNNs.},

  abstract = {Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) is crucial for decision-making to precisely forecast the future values/trends, based on the complex relationships identified from historical observations of multiple sequences. Recently, Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have gradually become the theme of MTSF model as their powerful capability in mining spatial-temporal dependencies, but almost of them heavily rely on the assumption of historical data integrity. In reality, due to factors such as data collector failures and time-consuming repairment, it is extremely challenging to collect the whole historical observations without missing any variable. In this case, STGNNs can only utilize a subset of normal variables and easily suffer from the incorrect spatial-temporal dependency modeling issue, resulting in the degradation of their forecasting performance. To address the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Graph Interpolation Attention Recursive Network (named GinAR) to precisely model the spatial-temporal dependencies over the limited collected data for forecasting. In GinAR, it consists of two key components, that is, interpolation attention and adaptive graph convolution to take place of the fully connected layer of simple recursive units, and thus are capable of recovering all missing variables and reconstructing the correct spatial-temporal dependencies for recursively modeling of multivariate time series data, respectively. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that GinAR outperforms 11 SOTA baselines, and even when 90\% of variables are missing, it can still accurately predict the future values of all variables.},

  abstract = {The advent of universal time series forecasting models has revolutionized zero-shot forecasting across diverse domains, yet the critical role of data diversity in training these models remains underexplored. Existing large-scale time series datasets often suffer from inherent biases and imbalanced distributions, leading to suboptimal model performance and generalization. To address this gap, we introduce BLAST, a novel pre-training corpus designed to enhance data diversity through a balanced sampling strategy. First, BLAST incorporates 321 billion observations from publicly available datasets and employs a comprehensive suite of statistical metrics to characterize time series patterns. Then, to facilitate pattern-oriented sampling, the data is implicitly clustered using grid-based partitioning. Furthermore, by integrating grid sampling and grid mixup techniques, BLAST ensures a balanced and representative coverage of diverse patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that models pre-trained on BLAST achieve state-of-the-art performance with a fraction of the computational resources and training tokens required by existing methods. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of data diversity in improving both training efficiency and model performance for the universal forecasting task.},
